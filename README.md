# EOAP CWL Wrap

`eoap-cwlwrap` is a command-line utility that composes a CWL `Workflow` from a series of `Workflow`/`CommandLineTool` steps, defined according to [Application package patterns based on data stage-in and stage-out behaviors commonly used in EO workflows](https://github.com/eoap/application-package-patterns), and **packs** it into a single self-contained CWL document.

It ensures:
- **Type-safe chaining** of step outputs to the next step's inputs.
- **Reusable, modular design** by keeping each step in its own file.
- **Packed output** ready for execution or distribution.
